    Gyroid does not have all the permissions required for commands

    Without these permissions, all commands will be withheld.

    The required permissions for Gyroid are:
    ```
    Embed Links
    Read Message History
    Attach Files
    ```

    The additional recommended permissions for Gyroid are:
    ```
    Manage Messages
    Add Reactions
    ```

    Currently missing required permissions:
    ```
    {0}
    ```

    Currently missing recommended permissions:
    ```
    {1}
    ```

    If the `Gyroid` role (or any other applied role) has these permissions, confirm that no channel overrides are causing the issue.
    If problems persist, join the support server: `q2j8HtB`
